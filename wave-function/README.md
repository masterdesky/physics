# Solution of the Schrödinger equation in 2D for the Hydrogene atom
The hydrogen is the simplest chemical element, which atomic form consist of a single, bounded electron and a proton. In this elementary case the Schrödinger equation has an exact solution, which could be used to describe the probability of finding the orbiting electron in a measurement at an arbitrary point in space. The solution of the Schrödinger equation called the "wave function" (denoted by the Greek letter psi ($\Psi$)) of the electron in question. In this case this $\Psi (r)$ function is only dependent on the distance vector (denoted by $r$) pointing to an arbitrary point in space from the proton in the center. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics the value $\left| \Psi (r) \right|^{2}$ (absolute value of the wave function, squared) is interpeted as the probabilty of finding the electron at the $r$ point.

The final pictures show the measurement probabilities of an electron in the hydrogen atom for different orbitals along the X-Z plane.
