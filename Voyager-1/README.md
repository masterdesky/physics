Fig. 1. - Fig. 2.: Voyager-1 crosses of the Termination Shock of the solar wind. The figure shows the intensity of the low energy particles (which is basically the solar wind itself).

Fig. 3.: Voyager-1 crosses the heliopause and becomes interstellar as the first human-made object reaching this far. The figure shows the intensity of the 70+ MeV particles, which basically represent the cosmic radiation in the interstellar medium.
Fig. 4.:  The figure shows the intensity of the low energy particles (which is basically the solar wind itself). As Voyager-1 enters the interstellar medium, the solar wind completely disappears.

========================

Events depicted on the figures:
--------------------------------

2004 December 17. -- The distance is 94 AU from the Sun. Voyager-1 crosses the border of the termination shock of the Solar System and enters the heliosheat. This is a layer boundary, which fully encompasses the Solar System, where solar wind slows down to subsonic velocities, creating a hot and turbulent flow around the boundary. This turbulence and the crossing of the termination shock can be easily seen on the data measured by the instruments of Voyager's Low Energy Telescopes. This can be seen on the first and second figures, where the intensity of 0.5+ MeV particles (basically the solar wind itself) is depicted.

2012 August 25. -- Distance is 121 AU from the Sun. Voyager-1 exists the heliosheat and enters the interstellar medium of our galaxy, becoming the first man-made object reaching this far. The boundary is called as "heliopause", where the intensity of the solar wind completely diminishes and the distribution of the lower and higher energy ions becomes uniform. Because the outer edge of the magnetic field of the Sun coincides with the heliopause, the intensity of the cosmic radiation also grows without now being diverted by a magnetic field. This event can be seen on the third and fourth figures. The third one shows the coincidence rate of the measurements of 70+ MeV particles (basically the cosmic particle radiation) by Voyager's High Energy Telescope. The fourth figure shows the intensity of the 0.5+ MeV particles again. The solar wind can be seen fading very rapidly and the intensity of the low energy particles becomes equal to the high energy radiation.
