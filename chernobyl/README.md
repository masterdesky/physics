# The gridded deposition data for Cs-137 over Europe on May 1, 1986

The Chernobyl nuclear disaster happened on this day 35 years ago. The magnitude of the disaster and its impact on the environment and humankind was out-of-imagination that time. As a consequence, the total activation of the nuclear material that was released into the atmosphere was 14 Ã— 10^18 Bq, over half of it being from inert noble gases (like Xe-33).

The complex series of the catastrophic events that led to the detonation of Reactor No. 4 in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (or officially the Vladimir Ilyich Lenin Nuclear Power Plant), nowadays are well-known [1]. The deficiencies in contemporary security protocols, lack of safety culture, the inherently flawed design of RMBK reactors and the Soviet Union's totalitarian control over information can be all attributed to the supervention of the nuclear accident that took place on April 26, 1986 at 01:24 AM [2].

The figure shows the map of the relative concentration of the Cs-137 isotope in the air on May 1, 1986. The Soviet Union stood absolutely no chance at keeping a disaster of this magnitude in secret.
